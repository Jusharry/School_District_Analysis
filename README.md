# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview 
The purpose of this analysis was to create a thorough representation of schools and student performance  for a school board using pre-defined metrics and also adjusting the data to account for potentially altered information.

## Results 
- After removing the requested scores for 9th graders in Thomas High school the overall measurable scores was reduced by 461 and as a result the district summary was also affected with all data ranges except average reading scores recording fractional declines.

- After updating the school summary dataframe it was observed that the percentage values had also similiarly decreased as seen below 









- Because the other grades (10-12) had similiar ranges of results for both reading and math the overall impact was not greatly affected relative to other schools





- Replacing the ninth - grade results caused the overall ninth grade percentage to drop only fractionally across 

- Math and reading scores by grade 

- Scores by school spending 

- Scores by school size 

- Scores by school type
